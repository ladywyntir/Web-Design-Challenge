- had to fiddle with each CSS item to ensure my colors were accurate
- the images are better when you use px or actual measurements rather than a percent. otherwise they tend to take on attributes of the window
- attempted to make the background image a little transparent and realized since i was applying the class to the body tag, it would make anything in the BODY transparent not the image.




800 x 550 is the size of the image

400 x 225

200 x 112.5

fonts: headers and text: #3e226b
hover color: rgba(152, 117, 216, 0.75)

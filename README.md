# Web Visualization Dashboard 
Module 1 Assignment - Web Design Challenge

## Background

Data is more powerful when we share it with others! Let's use what we've learned about HTML and CSS to create a dashboard featuring the analysis that we've done with the Weather API challenge.

### Code Theory
1. This was generally a lot of copying and pasting to ensure all the pages had the same content, with the exception of folders and locations.
2. Started with the source code provided and updated the colors, images and data itself from my Weeather API challenge dataset.
3. Ran a pandas code through Jupyter Notebook to pull the data into an HTML file.  Which was amazing because having to type out table html tags for 500+ rows would have made me quit programming forever.
4. Once the data was ready to go, I worked on the index.html file to get the look I was going for. Made some DIV columns to match what was on the assignment readme screenshots.
5. Once I had some content to tell the pages apart, I worked through the navbar along the top. 
6. Then I spent a lot of time finding each tag and color so I could make it my own purple theme. lol This took way longer than expected but I wanted to understand where each color call was coming from in the CSS file.
7. Next it was working on the picture sizing to make it fit within the DIV columns.  This was also done in the CSS file.
8. Wrapped the text around the summary in the index.html file.
9. Made sure the Visualizations on the page pointed to the correct pages.
10. Added my github repo to this project to the Navbar as well.  Just so the code would be easier to find.
11. Then worked on the Visualizations pages. Worked on the first then copied and pasted the rest and just updated the image links and their respective URLS.
12. The comparison.html wasn't too bad, just a lot of DIVS to divide the charts and their titles.
13. The data.html file was easy because of the csv_to_html magic I pulled from Pandas. Just fit that nicely in a DIV and the table came together no problem.
14. I went through each site and clicked on each link to see if it all worked.  I believe they are all functional.  I might have missed one or two.
15. I also added my sweet baby Kai as my logo at the top left corner.  That will bring you back to the home page - a little easter egg, if you will.
16. Used the DEV tool within Chrome like crazy.  Debugging was much easier when you could see the object that was causing the issue.
17. And of course updated the footer on every page!
